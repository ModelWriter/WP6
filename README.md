Work Package 6

**Work Package 6 - ModelWriter Architecture, Integration and Evaluation (Obeo)**

[`Product Backlog of WP6`](https://waffle.io/ModelWriter/WP6)

The product backlog itself is implemented in the [`issue tracker`](https://github.com/modelwriter/wp6/issues) of this repository

Objectives
---

The primary objective of this WP is to assemble and evaluate the successive yearly versions of the integrated ModelWriter. This objective is broken down into the following sub-objectives:

* Define the overall architecture of ModelWriter.
* Provide a unified Graphical User Interface (for both Model and Writer parts).
* Incrementally assemble each major release of the product (starting with a prototype and ending with a final product).
* Evaluate each major release against the WP1’s Industrial Use Cases and requirements that were selected as goals for the release.

There will be 1 major release a year, although partners will be invited to provide frequently minor releases of their work, to allow a continuous integration and testing of the software and `minimize the technical risk`.

Expected Results
---

* 3 major releases of ModelWriter (1 per year).
* Performance analysis and evaluation reports, incl. recommendations for next release.
